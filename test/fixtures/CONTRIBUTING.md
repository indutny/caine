### Caine's requirements

Hello! I am pleased to see your valuable contributing to this project.
Would you please mind answering a couple of questions to help me
classify this submission and/or gather required information for the
core team members?

#### Questions:

* _Issue-only_ Does this issue happen in core, or in some user-space
  module from npm or other source? Please ensure that the test case
  that reproduces this problem is not using any external dependencies.
  If the error is not reproducible with just core modules - it is most
  likely not a io.js problem. _Expected: `yes`_
* Which part of core do you think it might be related to?
  _One of: `tls, crypto, buffer, http, https, assert, util, streams,
  other`_ (_label_)
* Which versions of io.js do you think are affected by this?
  _One of: `v0.10, v0.12, v1.0.0`_ (_label_)
* _PR-only_ Does `make test` pass after applying this Pull Request.
  _Expected: `yes`_
* _PR-only_ Is the commit message properly formatted? (See
  CONTRIBUTING.md for more information)
  _Expected: `yes`_

Please provide the answers in an ordered list like this:

1. Answer for the first question
2. Answer for the second question
3. ...

Note that I am just a bot with a limited human-reply parsing abilities,
so please be very careful with numbers and don't skip the questions!

_In case of success I will say:_ `...summoning the core team devs!`.

_In case of validation problem I will say:_ `Sorry, but something is not right
here:`.

Truly yours,
Caine.
